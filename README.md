# Ruby Practice

These problems are designed to help you practice becoming a fluent programmer. They are short and sweet, much like the types of questions you will be asked in a job interview.

You shouldn't be very concerned with getting the "right" answer as fast as possible. Rather, you should focus on improving with each problem. If it takes you a while to remember the syntax for writing a method or looping through a list, keep practicing and focusing on those skills. With enough practice, it will become second nature.

## Usage

Each problem has driver code at the bottom so you can test your solution by running the code in Sublime (Command + B). If you're familiar with rspec, you should run the appropriate spec file for more accurate testing.
